Name: wrap

Description:
This example shows how to:
     A. call the source-to-source translator, sPyC, and convert a Python function HLS-suitable C code
     B. call the python linker, Pylon, to generate a wrapper/binding
     C. call the python rewriter, Pyrite, to rewrite the original source code to call the C function
Next, we execute the original python code and the rewritten python code which calls the C function instead of the python function. The execution times obtained after executing the codes indicate that the rewritten code runs faster than the original code.

Instructions:
0. make
   This performs the 3 steps identified above
   
1. make build
   This compiles the generated C code with the wrapper into a python package

2. make test
   This executes the original python code, then executes the rewritten python code to call the generated C from python
