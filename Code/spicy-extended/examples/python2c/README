Name: python2c

Description:
This example shows how to call the source-to-source translator, sPyC, and convert a Python function to HLS-suitable C code. Next, a C testbench is created that compiles the generated code, tests it on the host PC and validates the result by comparing it with the results from the python testbench.

Instructions:
0. make test-py
   This executes the python code (that contains a python testbench)
   
1. make
   This translates the python function into C, then compiles the C testbench code

2. make test-c
   This executes the C testbench code (to validate that the results are the same as in the python testbench)
